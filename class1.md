# De-centring creation: Disenchantement of Nature
```
"Decentering creation" refers to the idea of shifting the focus of creation away from a central authority or creator. This concept is often associated with the idea of "disenchantment," which refers to the loss of belief in magic, superstition, and the supernatural. In the context of nature, disenchantment might refer to the loss of belief in the spiritual or divine aspects of the natural world, and instead viewing nature as a purely material and mechanical system. This shift in perspective can be seen as a product of the rise of scientific and secular worldviews, which have challenged traditional belief systems and ways of understanding the world.
